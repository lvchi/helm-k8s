Text Direction : Create & Deploy HELM Chart on Cluster
##Create HELM Chart

- helm create <chart-name>

- Name of the chart provided here will be the name of the directory where the chart is created and stored.



```

Let's understand the relevance of these files and folders created for us:



Chart.yaml: This is the main file that contains the description of our chart

values.yaml: this is the file that contains the default values for our chart

templates: This is the directory where Kubernetes resources are defined as templates

charts: This is an optional directory that may contain sub-charts

```



##HELM Commands for Chart

- helm lint <chart-full-path>

#This is a simple command that takes the path to a chart and runs a battery of tests to ensure that the chart is well-formed



- helm template <chart-full-path>

#This will generate all templates with variables without a Tiller Server, for quick feedback, and show the output. Now that we know everything is OK, we can deploy the chart:





- helm install --name <release-name> <chart-full-path>

#Run this command to install the chart into the Kubernetes cluster:
